- **Khulna Mode**: References authentic Bangladeshi slang and locations

### Key README Elements:
1. **Shock Warning** - Clearly states the bot's nature upfront  
2. **Controlled Edginess** - Documents toxicity levels for different deployments  
3. **Satire Disclaimer** - Critical for avoiding platform bans  
4. **Visual Hierarchy** - GIFs/screenshots show personality before code  

Want me to:  
- Add a **"Roast Gallery"** section with example outputs?  
- Include **API warning hooks** for platforms like Discord?  
- Create a **toxicity calibration guide**?  

Let me know which parts need more/less edge!
